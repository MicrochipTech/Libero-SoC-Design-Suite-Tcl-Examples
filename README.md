## Welcome to the Libero&reg; SoC Design Suite advanced Tcl examples GitHub Repository! 

This is a code repository designed primarily for use with the Libero&reg; SoC Design Suite. Click [here](../Basic-Tcl-Examples/README.md) if you are looking for basic Tcl command examples.

>**NOTE:** Download and install the latest version of Libero SoC Design Suite from [LiberoÂ® SoC Design Suite](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/libero-software-later-versions#Download%20Software) before working with the examples provided in this repository. For more information on Libero SoC Design Suite installation and licensing setup, see [Libero Software Installation and Licensing Setup Guide](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-2B912F84-D8B3-4DF0-B08E-DA7E8A195A97-en-US-4/index.html).

The following table describes each Libero SoC Design Suite advanced examples in this repository. Click on the hyperlinks to go to the example location, where you will see a list of files. Click on the file you are interested in to view the source code.


|Tcl Example | Description |
|------------|-------------|
|[HDL to Programming Flow](HDL_to_programming_flow)| The TCL script in this example creates a new Libero project, imports HDL and constraint files. Runs through complete design flow from synthesis to device programming.
|[FPExpress Flow](FPExpress_flow)| The Tcl scripts in this example use job/stp file exported from Libero and run device programming in the standalone FlashPro Express (FPExpress) tool.
|[SmartDebug Flow](SmartDebug_flow)| The Tcl script in this example uses Smartdebug to read the embedded micro programmable read-only memory (uPROM) content programmed onto the device.
|[SmartDebug PCIe Register Read](SmartDebug_PCIe_Register_read)| The Tcl script in this example creates a PCIe EndPoint design(DG0756_PF_PCIe_EP) by instantiating required components in SmartDesign and by importing verilog files.
|[SmartDebug XCVR Debug Flow](SmartDebug_XCVR)| The Tcl script in this example creates a XCVR design by instantiating required components in SmartDesign and by importing verilog files.
>**NOTE:** An example is a group or collection of one or more Tcl scripts. The entire repository is managed by a moderator.
